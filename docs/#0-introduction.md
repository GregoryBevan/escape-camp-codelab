# Escape Camp Code Lab
You probably think that you're here to discover a new way of coding. It's true, but you're also enrolled as a contestant of a game.

The rule of this game is simple. To be able to display the next step of the code lab, you need to first resolve a riddle.

The winner will be the fastest to solve all the riddles.

## Requirements
Before starting, you need to :
- IntelliJ Idea
- Git
- Postman
- Docker
- A PostgreSQL client

## GitHub repository
To follow this code lab, you're going to checkout this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GregoryBevan/escape-camp-codelab)
- Open a terminal (or use any Git tool you like)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/GregoryBevan/escape-camp-codelab
```

One last thing, ask your neighbour if he wants to be part of a your team ;)
